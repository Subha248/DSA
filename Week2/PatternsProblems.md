### Question:
Write a Java program to print a series of asterisks (`*`) in increasing order, separated by spaces. Each term contains as many asterisks as its position.  

**Example:**
- Input: `N = 3`  
- Output: `* ** ***`

---

### Code:
```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
    int N = scan.nextInt();

    for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
      for (int j = 1; j <= i; j++) {
        System.out.print("*");
      }
      System.out.print(" ");
    }
  }
}
```
### Explanation:

1. **Input:**  
   - Read `N`, which is the number of terms to print.

2. **Outer Loop (`i`):**  
   - Runs from `1` to `N`.  
   - Controls the number of groups of asterisks to print.

3. **Inner Loop (`j`):**  
   - Runs from `1` to `i`.  
   - Prints `i` asterisks in each group.

4. **Space:**  
   - After printing each group of asterisks, a space is added to separate the groups.

---

**Example Walkthrough (N = 3):**  
- For `i = 1`, print `*`.  
- For `i = 2`, print `**`.  
- For `i = 3`, print `***`.  
- Add a space after each group.  

**Output:**  
```
* ** ***
```


### Question 2: Print a Right-Angled Number Triangle

**Problem Statement**:  
Write a program to print a right-angled number triangle pattern. For a given input \(N\), the first row should contain numbers from 1 to \(N\), the second row from 1 to \(N-1\), and so on until the last row contains only the number 1.

---

### Code:
```java
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int N = 4; // You can change N to any desired value
        for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= N - i + 1; j++) {
                System.out.print(j);
            }
            System.out.println(""); // Move to the next line after each row
        }
    }
}
```

---

### Output (For N = 4):
```
1234
123
12
1
```

---

### Explanation:
1. **Outer Loop** (`for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++)`): Controls the number of rows. The value of \(i\) starts at 1 and increments up to \(N\).
2. **Inner Loop** (`for (int j = 1; j <= N - i + 1; j++)`): Prints numbers from 1 to \(N - i + 1\) for each row. As \(i\) increases, the number of columns decreases.
3. **Line Break** (`System.out.println("")`): Moves to the next line after printing each row.

### Sample 1:

**Input:**
```plaintext
n = 4
```

**Expected Output:**
```plaintext
****
***
**
*
```

---

### Code:
```java

import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      Scanner scan=new  Scanner(System.in);
      int N= scan.nextInt();
      for(int i=1;i<=N;i++){
        for(int j=1;j<=N-i+1;j++){
          System.out.print("*");
        }
      
      System.out.println("");
      }
  }
}
```

This program prints an inverted triangle of stars (\(*\)) based on user input \(N\).

### Steps:
1. **Input**: User enters a number \(N\) (size of the triangle).
2. **Outer Loop**: Runs \(N\) times (for each row).
3. **Inner Loop**: Prints \(N - i + 1\) stars in each row, decreasing as rows increase.
4. **Line Break**: Moves to the next row after printing stars.

### Example:
**Input**: `4`  
**Output**:
```
****
***
**
*
``` 

It prints \(N\) stars in the first row, then decreases by one star in each subsequent row.



### Sample 2

**Input**:
```
n = 6
```
---
**Output**:
******
*****
****
***
**
*


### Code
```java
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in); // Create Scanner object for user input
        System.out.print("Enter the value of n: "); // Prompt for input
        int N = scan.nextInt(); // Take user input for n
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) { // Outer loop for rows
            for (int j = 1; j <= N - i + 1; j++) { // Inner loop for stars
                System.out.print("*");
            }
            System.out.println(""); // Move to the next row
        }
        scan.close(); // Close Scanner to prevent resource leak
    }
}
```

---

### Explanation

1. **Input**:  
   - The program takes a number \( n \) as input from the user.
2. **Logic**:  
   - The outer loop (`for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++)`) controls the number of rows.  
   - The inner loop (`for (int j = 1; j <= N - i + 1; j++)`) controls the number of stars (\(*\)) in each row.  
   - As the row number increases, the number of stars decreases.
3. **Output**:  
   - The program prints \( n \) stars in the first row, \( n-1 \) in the second, and so on until the last row contains 1 star.
