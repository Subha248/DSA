This program is a **pattern printing program** in Java. It prints a rectangular block of `*` (asterisks) for a given value of `n` (rows and columns).

### Code Explanation:
```java
class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = 4; // Number of rows and columns

        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {         // Outer loop for rows
            for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {     // Inner loop for columns
                System.out.print("*");         // Print star without moving to the next line
            }
            System.out.println("");            // Move to the next line after each row
        }
    }
}
```

### How It Works:
1. **`int n = 4`**: Sets the number of rows and columns.
2. **Outer Loop (`i`)**:
   - Controls the **number of rows** (from `1` to `n`).

3. **Inner Loop (`j`)**:
   - Controls the **number of stars** printed in each row (from `1` to `n`).

4. **`System.out.print("*")`**:
   - Prints the star (`*`) without moving to the next line.

5. **`System.out.println("")`**:
   - Moves to the next line after printing all stars for one row.

### Execution for `n = 4`:

#### Step-by-Step:
- **Row 1**: Prints `****` → Moves to the next line.
- **Row 2**: Prints `****` → Moves to the next line.
- **Row 3**: Prints `****` → Moves to the next line.
- **Row 4**: Prints `****` → Moves to the next line.

---

### Output:
```
****
****
****
****
```

---

### Key Concepts:
1. **Nested Loops**:
   - Outer loop controls rows.
   - Inner loop controls columns (number of stars printed).

2. **`print()` vs `println()`**:
   - `print()` prints on the same line.
   - `println()` moves to the next line.

This program is the basic logic for **pattern printing** and can be modified to create various shapes like triangles, pyramids, etc.
