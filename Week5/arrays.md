### ðŸ’« Final Simple Explanation:

* In Java, **arrays of objects** are stored in the **heap memory**.
* **Heap memory** is used for **dynamic memory allocation** â€” meaning objects can be created and placed anywhere thereâ€™s free space.
* Because of that, **heap memory is not continuous**, so the **objects** inside an array are **not stored side by side**.
* The array itself only stores **references (addresses)** that point to those scattered objects.

### ðŸŒ¸ In one short line:

> Array of objects in Java are not stored continuously because they are stored in heap memory, where objects are dynamically allocated.
